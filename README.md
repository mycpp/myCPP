# Welcome to the Bredesen Center's Clean Power Plan Tool

This is a running repository of active code development for the Clean Power Plan tool aided at helping to understand the implications for states towards the EPA's Clean Power Plan.

## About
The University of Tennessee Bredesen Center and the University of Tennessee Nuclear Engineering department have undergone a multi-year collaborative effort in evaluating the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Clean Power Plan (CPP) for its accuracy and fair treatment of all energy sources. The Bredesen Center has used this research to develop a publication summarizing many inconsistencies found within the CPP. The final submission of the CPP draft by the EPA addressed the vast majority of this publication’s outlined concerns.

## Tool Development
To address this interest, the Bredesen Center is leading the collaborative effort through the development of a Clean Power Plan State Compliance Evaluation Tool to aide policymakers and members of the interested public in understanding state compliance pathways. This tool is in the process of deployment with a preliminary version scheduled for online distribution. The purpose of this tool is to be a widely accessible, user-friendly, and accurate representation of state compliance pathways.
